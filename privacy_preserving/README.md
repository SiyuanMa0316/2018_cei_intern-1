Self note: don't overthink issues too much (i.e. one small misunderstanding != everything confused and stuck). Also, just proceed step-by-step, don't fret too much on each step's limitations; they'll be mitigated in later implementation/steps.

## TODO for 2nd week (7/9-7/13)
 - [x] Write related work (500 words) (deadline: 7/10)
 - [x] Discussed the problem of current methods. (deadline: 7/10)
 - [x] Propose at least two ideas to solve the problem. (deadline: 7/10)
 - [x] Improve the current code (deadline: 7/10)
 - [x] Finish the code and run experiments for proposed methods(deadline: 7/12)
 - [ ] ~~Ask authors for code~~,   add noise (Laplace, Gaussian, gradient clipping) and try to recreate the epsilon vs. accuracy graph (start: 7/12 thurs end: 7/17 tuesday) (For basic noise only)
 
 ## TODO for 3rd week (7/16-7/20)
 - [ ] deadline for basic noise (7/17 tues); change to more advanced Covolutional NN
 - [ ] advanced CNN + need to understand/discuss/implement advanced noise method/privacy accountant （7/19 WED）（May need a side discussion of related literature）
 ~~try to reverse engineer inputs (7/17 start tues; 7/19 end thurs) (May not have enough time or simply as a side experiment)～～
