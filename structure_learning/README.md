 # TODO
 - [ ] Read all related papers
 - [ ] propose 1~2 ideas
 - [ ] initial experiment
 - [ ] new idea for NAS: let the controllerRNN generate recurrent cells for itself, instead of using a simple RNN
 - [ ] new idea for NAS: generate all structure imformation in the output layer of controllerRNN, instead of seperately in several outputs
 - [ ] new idea for NAS: use CNN as controller, train the target architecture and the controller at the same time
 - [ ] to reduce training time, adopt parameter sharing
 - [ ] new idea: adopt neural-evolution algorithm to train the controller
