Entropy in the Convolutional Neural Network

Introduction

This experiment aims at computing entropy in the CNN. And it's at the very initial stages.

Experiment Setup

We are currently using the  MNIST dataset. 

Requirements

pytorch 0.4.0
python 3.6

Code

deploy.py main function of the experiment
mnist_trainer.py  notes the train and test process for cnn
mnistmodels.py  stores the model for traing and test
read_data.py  extracts image data from the mnist dataset
entropy.py  notes the method to compute entropy of image

Usage

run deploy.py then you will get the entropy in the output window
